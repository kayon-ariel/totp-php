This PHP class can be used to interact with the Google Authenticator mobile app for 2-factor-authentication. This class
can generate secrets, generate codes, validate codes and present a QR-Code for scanning the secret. It implements TOTP 
according to [RFC6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238)

For a secure installation you have to make sure that used codes cannot be reused (replay-attack). You also need to
limit the number of verifications, to fight against brute-force attacks. For example you could limit the amount of
verifications to 10 tries within 10 minutes for one IP address (or IPv6 block). It depends on your environment.

Usage:
------

See following example:

```
See the example in the `example.php` file
```

Running the script provides the following output:
```
Secret is: OQB6ZZGYHCPSX4AK

Checking Code '848634' and Secret 'OQB6ZZGYHCPSX4AK':
OK
```

Installation:
-------------

- Use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md) to
  install the package

- From project root directory execute following

```composer install```

- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md) will take care of autoloading
  the library. Just include the following at the top of your file

  `require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';`
